# STAT-507X-Project-1-Vaccination-Data
Data Exploration and Visualization on U.S. Covid Vaccination Data

### Description
In this project, we are focused on the US COVID-19 vaccination data at the national and state level.
As of March 2021, there are three vaccine products available in the US. Different states are faced with a varied situation of vaccination, 
which would affect the transmission.
The purpose of the project is to clean and visualize vaccination data to explore the underlying dynamics, and investigate how to deal with the
issues when the data are sparse, incomplete and inconsistent in reporting frequencies. 

For the whole project, you can make use of the US-level historical vaccination data from
(https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends), state-level daily data from
(https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations), state-level daily historical data
from youyangguâ€™s GitHub, and state-level weekly vaccination data of Pfizer, Moderna,
Janssen, and/or any other data source online which you find valuable.
